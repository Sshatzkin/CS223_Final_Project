CS223 Final Project Report (Sam Shatzkin, Allison Zhang)

For our final project, we made a farming simulation game called ElmVale.

The object of the game is to earn ElmBucks and continue to unlock new plants. 
You use ElmBucks to buy plants, which you can then harvest for money. 
If you have enough money, you can unlock a new crop type.

We primarily used Elm Canvas to render the graphics for our game interface (in the 
ViewHelpers.elm module). All of our graphics are self-designed and imported through JavaScript.
The Elm Canvas library allowed us to render those images on screen and animate
certain features of the game (like the clouds and the tractor) by using Canvas
settings to translate the image.

Although Canvas allowed us greater flexibility with the UI, it also posed a big 
challenge when we realized that we were unable to assign a click handling event
to an individual Canvas renderable. In order to bypass this issue, we ended up writing
our own click handling functions and buttons (in the Button.elm module). These functions
determine if the player has made a valid click, and if so, pass on the corresponding
update. Also, because Elm does not allow circular dependencies, we moved many of
our essential data types (which contain game information stored in the model) into 
separate modules.

Some of the next steps on this project that we did not get to implement include 
adding additional game features to keep the game interesting (like more plants/animals)
and to implement some kind of page switching so there is a separate page for 
the upgrade store or a game menu with instructions.
